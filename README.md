## DevOps Dashboard: Real-Time Infrastructure Monitoring and Management

Developed a comprehensive and intuitive DevOps dashboard designed for real-time monitoring and management of cloud infrastructure and containerized applications. This project integrates modern DevOps practices and tools such as AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, and popular monitoring solutions to provide visibility into infrastructure health, application performance, and automated deployment pipelines. The dashboard is built to streamline the management of cloud environments, ensuring efficiency, scalability, and reliability while embracing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

### Key Features:

Real-time monitoring of cloud infrastructure and containerized applications.

Integration with Kubernetes for container orchestration.

Seamless deployment automation using Docker and Helm.

Implementation of automated monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

Easy-to-use interface for managing infrastructure and deployment pipelines.

This project demonstrates practical DevOps skills, focusing on automation, scalability, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.
